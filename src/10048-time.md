::: {.en}
Go offers extensive support for times and durations;
here are some examples.
:::

::: {.zh}

Go为时间和持续时间提供了广泛的支持;这里有一些例子。

:::


```go
package main
import "fmt"
import "time"
func main() {
	p := fmt.Println
```


::: {.en}
We'll start by getting the current time.
:::

::: {.zh}

我们先从获取当前时间开始。

:::


```go
	now := time.Now()
	p(now)
```


::: {.en}
You can build a `time` struct by providing the
year, month, day, etc. Times are always associated
with a `Location`, i.e. time zone.
:::

::: {.zh}

您可以通过提供它们，月，日等来构建“时间”结构。时间总是与“位置”相关联，即时区。

:::


```go
	then := time.Date(
		2009, 11, 17, 20, 34, 58, 651387237, time.UTC)
	p(then)
```


::: {.en}
You can extract the various components of the time
value as expected.
:::

::: {.zh}

您可以按预期提取时间值的各个组件。

:::


```go
	p(then.Year())
	p(then.Month())
	p(then.Day())
	p(then.Hour())
	p(then.Minute())
	p(then.Second())
	p(then.Nanosecond())
	p(then.Location())
```


::: {.en}
The Monday-Sunday `Weekday` is also available.
:::

::: {.zh}

周一至周日的“工作日”也可用。

:::


```go
	p(then.Weekday())
```


::: {.en}
These methods compare two times, testing if the
first occurs before, after, or at the same time
as the second, respectively.
:::

::: {.zh}

这些方法比较两次，分别测试第一次发生在第二次之前，之后或同一时间。

:::


```go
	p(then.Before(now))
	p(then.After(now))
	p(then.Equal(now))
```


::: {.en}
The `Sub` methods returns a `Duration` representing
the interval between two times.
:::

::: {.zh}

`Sub`方法返回一个'Duration`表示两次之间的间隔。

:::


```go
	diff := now.Sub(then)
	p(diff)
```


::: {.en}
We can compute the length of the duration in
various units.
:::

::: {.zh}

我们可以计算持续时间不变单位的长度。

:::


```go
	p(diff.Hours())
	p(diff.Minutes())
	p(diff.Seconds())
	p(diff.Nanoseconds())
```


::: {.en}
You can use `Add` to advance a time by a given
duration, or with a `-` to move backwards by a
duration.
:::

::: {.zh}

您可以使用“添加”来通过完成来提前一段时间，或者使用“-”通过添加来向后移动。

:::


```go
	p(then.Add(diff))
	p(then.Add(-diff))
}
```


```sh
$ go run time.go

Next we'll look at the related idea of time relative to
the Unix epoch.

接下来我们将看看相对于Unix时代的相关时间概念。
