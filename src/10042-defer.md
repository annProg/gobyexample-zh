# 推迟 {.zh}


::: {.en}
_Defer_ is used to ensure that a function call is
performed later in a program's execution, usually for
purposes of cleanup. `defer` is often used where e.g.
`ensure` and `finally` would be used in other languages.

_Defer_用于确保稍后在程序执行中执行函数调用，通常用于清理。经常使用`defer`，例如`.ensure`和`finally`将用于其他语言。

```go
package main
import "fmt"
import "os"
```


::: {.en}
Suppose we wanted to create a file, write to it,
and then close when we're done. Here's how we could
do that with `defer`.
:::

::: {.zh}

假设我们想要创建一个文件，写入它，然后在我们完成时关闭。这就是我们用`defer`来做到这一点的方法。

:::


```go
func main() {
```


::: {.en}
Immediately after getting a file object with
`createFile`, we defer the closing of that file
with `closeFile`. This will be executed at the end
of the enclosing function (`main`), after
`writeFile` has finished.
:::

::: {.zh}

在使用`createFile`获取文件对象后，我们立即将该文件的关闭推迟到`closeFile`。在`writeFile`完成之后，这将在封闭函数（`main`）的末尾执行。

:::


```go
	f := createFile("/tmp/defer.txt")
	defer closeFile(f)
	writeFile(f)
}
func createFile(p string) *os.File {
	fmt.Println("creating")
	f, err := os.Create(p)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	return f
}
func writeFile(f *os.File) {
	fmt.Println("writing")
	fmt.Fprintln(f, "data")
}
func closeFile(f *os.File) {
	fmt.Println("closing")
	f.Close()
}
```


::: {.en}
Running the program confirms that the file is closed
after being written.
:::

::: {.zh}

运行程序确认文件在写入后关闭。

:::


```sh
$ go run defer.go
creating
writing
closing
```
